# Dijkstra-Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used to find the shortest paths from a start node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

# Prerequisites

Before you run this program, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.x is recommended. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# Installation

No additional libraries are required to run this script, as it only uses the Python Standard Library. Simply clone this repository or download the source code.

# Usage

To run the program, use the following command from the terminal:

python Djikstras_Algorithm.py

This will execute the script and display the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes in the console.
